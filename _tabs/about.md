## 🧠 Who Am I?

Hey there! I'm **Jay Tiwari**, a passionate **Red Teamer** currently in my **3rd year of engineering**. I live and breathe offensive security — from breaching Active Directory to crafting custom payloads. My playground? Platforms like **Hack The Box**, **Vulnlab**, **TryHackMe**, and **internal labs**, where I sharpen my skills daily.

If it involves domain dominance, evasion tactics, or post-exploitation magic — I’m in.
